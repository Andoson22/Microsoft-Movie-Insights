This data came from a combination of the **bom.movie_gross.csv.gz** and **tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz** files.  We then cleaned the data, and removed any missing values we still had.  Then we converted the data types of the month column to integers as well as the currency columns to floats in order to further work with the information.\n",
